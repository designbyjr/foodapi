## API Challenge
The language I am most familar with is PHP. I have chossen Laravel as a framework because it has extra features for handling files.
It also has unit testing built in with the framework which is useful for testing RESTful API endpoints.

I have also opted for Laravel because if the resource where to expand to interact with other microservices it would be easy to implement.

I have opted for Get, Post, Put and Delete to explictly state what I am deleting. This also follows CRUD, 
to ensure routes match methods making sure my code is maintainable.
I have also ensured that I have complied with the HTTPS-only standard to ensure data remains encrypted on transit.

If i had the option of caching i would have used redis or even a database, however since this task is based on a file,
i have opted to use collections. This will ensure i can retrive from a collection when i need to.

Collections also have the advantage to be modified but also easily accessable ensuring that if future changes where to happen the code would not be redundent.

Mobile devices such as iOS and Andriod handle JSON Objects differently, that is why i have created an order for READ responses, 
ensuring the device can present data in the correct way.

## Installation
You will require the following prerequisites:

PHP 5.6+ installed Globally on your machine. If not installed go to the PHP <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/install.php">website</a>.

You will also need the latest version of Composer. If you are unsure if you have composer installed,
open Terminal (Linix) or the Command line (Windows) and type in composer and hit return. 

If a menu does not appear you will have to install it from this <a href="https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md">Link</a>.

Before you go any further make sure both PHP and composer run. This can be done with "composer.phar" or "composer" or "php composer".
PHP can be tested by running "php -i"; Menus should appear for both php and composer.

Once PHP and Composer are installed run the command below in the directory you want to run the code in:

```
	Composer require designbyjr/apichallenge
```

Now change the directory your in to apichallenge and find the changeme.env file and rename it to .env

Then run the following code:

```
	Composer install
```

## How It Works

The following are crud methods which have been tested in <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/apps">Postman</a> with a JSON body payload, the routes can be also tested with CURL and PHP Unit.

**Create**

The following options are optional and will be stored as null if not provided:
bulletpoint1,
bulletpoint2,
bulletpoint3,
short_title,
in_your_box

The following Curl example shows the typical body content to be sent in a Post action.


`curl -d`

```json

			}
		}
}
```

`-H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST https://demo.demo/api/`

**Create Response**

The response from create should be a 200 and the following json response. 


**Read**

The Curl below is requesting one object.

`curl -d
-H "Content-Type: application/json" -X **GET**  https://demo.demo/api/?id[]=1`

The Curl below is requesting more than one object.

`curl -d
-H "Content-Type: application/json" -X **GET**  https://demo.demo/api/?id[]=1,2`

**Read Response**

The Response should be like this with a 200 response. The time has been converted to milliseconds so that mobile and web devices can handle date time. This currently shows one recipe as an example.

```json
{
	"response": 200,
	"links":{
		"self": "https://demo.demo/api/"
	},
	"data": [{
		"0": {
			"id":1,
			"created_at": 1435683480000,
			"updated_at": 1435683480000,
			"recipe_cuisine": "asian",
			"box_type": "vegetarian",

				"shelf_life_days": 4,
				"equipment_needed": "Appetite",

				"fat_grams": 35,
				"carbs_grams": 0,

			}
		}
	}]
}
```

The request below requests all recepies.

`curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X **GET**  https://demo.demo/api/cuisine`


The request below is for cuisine(s) which allow you to mutli-select cuisines and also specify the limit the page will return. The Maximum limit is 5. Cuisines are sorted by id.

`curl -d
{
    "cuisine": ["asian","italian"],
    "limit":3
}
-H "Content-Type: application/json" -X **GET**  https://demo.demo/api/cuisine`

**Read Response Cuisine**

The Response should have pagination links, any links that cannot be generated will return null. To paginate you can use the links provided or by changing the curl request with a different number at the end. A 404 Not Found will return if a page is not available.

```json
{
	"response": 200,
	"page":1,
	"links": {
			"self": "https://demo.demo/api/cuisine",

			}
		}
	}]
}
```


**Delete**

The delete request below is for receipes which allow you to mutli-select recipes by ID. This will return a 200 if successful. A 404 will be returned if the ID is not found. A 500 will be for a method failure.

`curl -d
{
    "id": [1]
}
 -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X **DELETE** https://demo.demo/api
 `

**Update**

This will update request **does not allow a mutli-select option with an array**, properties should be contained inside the modify object, if a modify object is incomplete or ill-formed or empty a 500 will be returned. If an ID cannot be found it will be a 404.

`curl -d
{
    "id":2,
    modify:{
    	"protein_source": "beef"
    }
}
-H "Content-Type: application/json" -X **PUT** https://demo.demo/api`

This will return the modified version of the recipe that was to be updated.

**Rating Recipe Update**

This will update request **does not allow a mutli-select option with an array**, properties should be contained inside the modify object, if a modify object is incomplete or ill-formed or empty a 500 will be returned. If an ID cannot be found it will be a 404. If a rating is not within a range of 1 and 5 a 400 will be returned forming a bad request.

`curl -d
{
   "0":{
		"id":2,
		modify:{
		    	"rating": 5
		    	}
		}
}
-H "Content-Type: application/json" -X **PUT** https://demo.demo/api`

This will return the modified version of the recipe that was to be updated.
